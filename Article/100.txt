We seek to establish a new paradigm of robust model selection 
for experimental nuclear physics.  For instance, since 1976
the proton radius and its uncertainty have remained nearly 
the same, while the models used to extract those values 
have become increasingly complex and convoluted.  In this work,  
we clearly demonstrate the importance of balancing bias and variance 
in model selection and illustrate a straightforward approach 
to constructing optimal parsimonious models.  As this work connects 
nuclear and statistical physics, and is applicable to model
design in other branches of science as well, Phys. Rev. X 
is the ideal journal for it.
